Question: what is oop?
Student Answer: OOP is object oriented programming.It is composed of classes and objects. It has functions like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and so on. It is used by languages like C++, java, python, etc. It is considered more efficient than procedural oriented programming as it can be reused further and provides answer faster.
